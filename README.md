# Word-Guess-Game
In this application, the user has to guess the name of a Miami sports team. In doing so, the user can have ten incorrect letter guesses on the random Miami sports team name that was generated. To pick a letter, the user presses a key on their keyboard, the program checks to see if that letter exists in the name and if it does, the letter shows up on the screen as part of the word. If the letter doesn't exist in the randomly generated name, the program subtracts one from the number of tries remaining.
